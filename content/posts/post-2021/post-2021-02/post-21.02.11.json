      "<p>The Kiyosumi Shirakawa district of Tokyo has become somewhat of a coffee destination. With the appearance of two big players, the Allpress Espresso Tokyo Roastery & Cafe in 2014 and Japan’s first Blue Bottle roastery in 2016, it quickly gained popularity. Beforehand, and still today actually, the community specialty roastery ‘Arise Coffee Roasters’ was one of its kind in the neighbourhood. Nowadays, these three build a coffee-triangle with Arise, Blue Bottle and Allpress Espresso all in close proximity to each other.</p>",

      "<p>The timber storage warehouse that is home to New Zealand’s favourite coffee roastery, (which started 1989 as a simple coffee cart - impressive, huh?), was carefully restored to celebrate its past while giving it a new purpose in the present. Café, roastery and training facilities are all under one roof and open for guests to learn, taste and enjoy. Their signature <a href='/'>Allpress Espresso Blend</a> is made up of four different origins, namely Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala & Sumatra, to create a sweet, balanced and complex brew. While it will always be on one of the grinders, the available single origin beans vary.</p>"
