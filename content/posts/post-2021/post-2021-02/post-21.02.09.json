    "<p>Japan is the home country of % Arabica, and we are excited to now serve our loyal customers here in the picturesque Northern city of Niseko; one of the world’s greatest ski destinations. We are located in the centre of Niseko, called Hirafu. The kiosk is part of Hirafu188, which is a commercial space and accommodation complex in one. All day, skiers and snowboarders walk up to Niseko Mt. resort, along the road beside us as they head for a day on the slopes.</p>",

    "<p>The trailer kiosk has become a trademark of % Arabica countries worldwide, and the inviting design is instantly recognizable, by design as well as its fast flowing, functionally designed space for customers to pass bye and grab a coffee as they go about their day. We are also happy that our baristas from Kyoto stores can come to Niseko in the winter months to work, ski or snowboard and brew amazing coffee for the ski community – another chance for us to spread our See The World Through Coffee ethos.</p>"
