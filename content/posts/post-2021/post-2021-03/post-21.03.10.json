    "<p>Sourcing beans from all over the world gives Glitch Coffee & Roasters an edge over the rest. Because of that, this coffee shop has accumulated a decent size of raving, coffee-loving fans. The display of all the roasts offered in the middle of the cafe space is a wonderful detail to the store. Not only does it add on to the aesthetics but it also gives a sense of what Glitch Coffee has to offer to the customers.</p>",

    "<p>Glitch is the perfect place for a lighter roast. The Guatemalan one seems to be a huge hit with the crowd. If youâ€™re overwhelmed by the choices they have, the staff are more than willing to offer suggestions such as the fruity Kenya Karinga AA or whatever else that is preferable for your coffee palate. Packed with a powerful coffee range alongside the kissaten-inspired decor, Glitch is a one-stop for all the coffee drinkers.</p>"
