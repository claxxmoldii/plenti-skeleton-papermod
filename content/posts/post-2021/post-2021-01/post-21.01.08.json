    "<p>For a little window into the third wave of Tokyo’s coffee scene, About Life is a must-visit spot. It’s one of many stylish shops in the heart of bustling Shibuya. This area is popular with both the hip tourist crowd and Japanese third wave enthusiasts. You wouldn’t know it from the name, but About Life is the second location of Onibus Coffee. The team behind these cafés are obsessive about quality: every drink is test-tasted to make sure it meets their standards and the quality control manager is almost always on staff.</p>", 

    "<p>One of the coolest things about this <a class='italic' href='/'>café</a>  is that it also offers you a choice of drip and espresso coffees from other Tokyo roasters. And they regularly feature international beans and guest baristas. What’s more, the sleek, clean design of this compact specialty coffee café has attracted many admirers and may make it worth a visit in its own right – it’s now one of the most Instagrammed shops in <a href='/'>Japan</a>. Just search <i>#aboutlifecoffeebrewers</i> to see what I mean.</p>"
