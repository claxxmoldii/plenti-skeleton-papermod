  "body": "<p>Yes, it’s a Starbucks, but not as you know it. Co-designed by architect Kengo Kuma, Nakameguro’s Reserve Roastery is the largest Starbucks in the world. The building incorporates Japanese design elements, such as origami-inspired ceilings and delicate cherry blossoms around the huge, hammered-copper cask rising through the centre of the building. The flowers are inspired by the springtime views over the river just outside, which is lined with sakura trees. On the floors above the roastery and café, the building houses Princi bakery, Teavana and the Arriviamo bar.</p>"
