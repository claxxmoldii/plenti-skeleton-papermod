  "body": "<p>Just across from Yoyogi Park in Shibuya, you’ll find Little Nap Coffee Stand, a tiny coffee shop with a few extra seats outside. It has a laid-back atmosphere and the friendly owner, Daisuke Hamada, will be more than happy to engage in conversation with visitors. The high-quality beans are roasted on-site, and the <a href='/'>menu</a> includes single-origin drip coffee along with the typical espresso-based drinks, which are prepared on a Synesso machine.</p>"
