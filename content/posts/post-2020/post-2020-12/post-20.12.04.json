    "<p>Open for 25 years, Chatei Hatou is a slice of traditional Tokyo kissaten culture in the middle of hypermodern Shibuya. The interior is cool and quiet, clad in dark wood accented with greenery, there’s no WiFi to distract you and you can only pay in cash. The drinks aren’t cheap, but they’re expertly made from the highest-quality ingredients, whether bean or leaf, and there’s always a tempting array of cakes to enjoy as you linger over the cup. As with most traditional kissaten, smoking is allowed here, so bear that in mind if it’ll ruin your meditation on the perfect cup of dark-roast coffee.</p>"
