    "<p>Owned by latte art champion Hiroshi Sawada, Streamer Coffee Company is one of the most popular coffee shops in Tokyo. Unsurprisingly, given the owner, every cup of coffee comes with latte art, whether a cute cartoon character or intricate leaf pattern. In all of the Tokyo branches, the decor is sleek and industrial and there’s good free WiFi, so you can catch up on work while indulging in the wonderful coffee. The star attraction is the Streamer Latte, served in a soup bowl-sized mug.</p>"
