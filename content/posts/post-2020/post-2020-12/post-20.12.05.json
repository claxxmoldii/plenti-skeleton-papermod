    "<p>Sarutahiko Coffee was established in 2011 by the actor Tomoyuki Otsuka, with the goal of bringing a smile to your face with just one cup of coffee. The intimate Ebisu flagship store can seat up to 25 people, serving drip coffee and espresso drinks from the Synesso machine, and the single-origin beans and blends are high quality. The space is warm, welcoming and unpretentious, and you can buy beans to take home with you.</p>"
